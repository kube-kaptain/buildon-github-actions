# manifest-patch-apply.bash - Apply yq patches to the manifests beside them
#
# See YqPatches.md for the design. The grammar (what a patch file is called,
# which types exist, what a description may hold) lives in
# lib/manifest-file-kinds.bash; this library is only about applying them.
#
# Each target is patched inside its own sandbox holding that manifest and its
# own patches and nothing else, so a patch for one file cannot reach another
# and every intermediate state is left behind for provenance. The result is
# copied back over the target.
#
# Three rules apply to every patch, whatever its type:
#
#   The baseline is NORMALISED, not the original bytes. yq reformats a whole
#   file even for a semantic no-op (indentation normalised, comment spacing
#   collapsed), so comparing raw bytes would report "changed" for a patch that
#   did nothing and the no-op rule would be defeated by its own tooling.
#
#   A patch that changes nothing FAILS. yq exits 0 and says nothing when an
#   expression matches no path, so the diff is the only thing that will notice.
#
#   Output is checked by SHAPE, not by parsing. yq cannot emit invalid YAML -
#   `null`, a bare scalar and `del(.)` all re-parse cleanly - so a parse check
#   can never fail. Non-empty, a mapping, with kind and apiVersion is the check
#   that catches a line which destroyed the manifest.
#
# Functions:
#   manifest_patch_tree - apply every patch in a tree, in order, per target
#
# Requires lib/log.bash and lib/manifest-file-kinds.bash. Requires yq 4.
#
# shellcheck disable=SC2154  # MANIFEST_FILE_* set by lib/manifest-file-kinds.bash
# shellcheck disable=SC2016  # '$ENV' is a yq operator name, not a shell expansion

# Operators that read outside the patch file. Banned in the two expression
# types, which is a boundary the sandbox cannot provide: yq's file operators
# take any path, so `..` and absolute paths resolve against the real
# filesystem regardless of which directory the patch is applied in.
#
# Verified reachable without this: load_str reads any file as a raw string,
# strenv reads any environment variable, and either can be written straight
# into a manifest that is then packaged and pushed.
#
# yq has no dynamic function dispatch, so a name cannot be computed at runtime
# and a literal check is robust rather than a speed bump. merge-yaml is exempt:
# its content is data that is never evaluated, and scanning it would reject a
# ConfigMap holding `env: production` or a key called `load`.
# Matched as the CALL form, with the opening paren, so a manifest key legitimately
# named 'env' is not mistaken for the operator that reads the environment. Listed
# longest first because the shorter names are substrings of the longer ones, and
# each match is stripped before the next is looked for, so a violation is named
# as what it actually is rather than as whatever prefix matched first.
