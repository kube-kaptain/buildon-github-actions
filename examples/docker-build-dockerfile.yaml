# Docker Build Dockerfile
#
# Build a Docker image from a Dockerfile with --squash (default) to flatten
# layers into one, reducing image size, hiding intermediate layer history, and
# ensuring Dockerfiles are clean by not having to clean up and use && all the time.
#
# Place your Dockerfile at src/docker/Dockerfile (the default path).
#
# - PRs: Build with version-PRERELEASE tag (not pushed)
# - Push to main: Git tag, build, docker tag with clean version, push to GHCR
#
# Copy this to .github/workflows/build.yaml in your repo.
