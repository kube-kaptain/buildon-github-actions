# Optional Test Script Injection
#
# Shows how to add custom test scripts to workflows that support them.
#
# Available inputs and workflows that support them:
# - pre-tagging-tests-script-sub-path:  basic-quality-and-versioning, docker-build-dockerfile
# - post-docker-tests-script-sub-path:  docker-build-dockerfile
#
# Scripts must be:
# - Located under .github/ (the input is a sub-path from there)
# - Executable (chmod +x)
#
# Post-docker tests receive environment variables:
# - VERSION, VERSION_MAJOR, VERSION_MINOR, VERSION_PATCH
# - VERSION_2_PART, VERSION_3_PART, VERSION_4_PART
# - DOCKER_TAG, DOCKER_IMAGE_NAME, PROJECT_NAME, IS_RELEASE
# - TARGET_IMAGE_FULL_URI (the locally-built image to test)
#
# Copy this to .github/workflows/build.yaml in your repo.
