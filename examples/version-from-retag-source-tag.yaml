# Version From Retag Source Tag
#
# Extract version from the source-tag input in a retag workflow file.
# The version tracks the upstream image you're retagging.
#
# The version series (major.minor) is extracted, then the patch is auto-incremented
# based on existing tags in that series.
#
# Example: docker-source-tag: '3.21' below
#   - First build: tags 3.21.1
#   - Second build: tags 3.21.2
#   - Update to 3.22: tags 3.22.1
#
# Copy this to .github/workflows/build.yaml in your repo.
