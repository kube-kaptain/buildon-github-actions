# Contributing

## Intellectual Property Requirements

Before your contributions can be accepted, you must demonstrate that your current employment contract does not contain a greedy IP clause that claims ownership of work done in your own time.

You can satisfy this requirement by:

1. Providing the relevant clause from your contract to the maintainer(s) in confidence
2. Providing proof that you are currently unemployed or self-employed

This protects the project from legal action by employers who may later claim ownership of code written and submitted by their employees. Several open-source projects have been severely damaged by having to remove contributions that were not legally owned by the person who submitted them.


## Known Cases

**Alarming Development vs. Employee (2019)**

A former employee of Alarming Development, a web development company, contributed code to an open-source project called "Nanobox" during his employment. The employee believed he had the right to contribute to the project in his spare time. However, Alarming Development claimed ownership of the code under the terms of the employee's contract, which assigned all intellectual property created during employment to the company. The dispute led to the employee's contributions being removed from the Nanobox project.

**Blender Institute vs. Employee (2014)**

A former employee of the Blender Institute, a non-profit organisation that develops the open-source 3D software Blender, contributed code to the Blender project during his employment. The employee argued that he had created the code in his spare time and that it was not related to his work at the Blender Institute. However, the Blender Institute claimed ownership of the code under the terms of the employee's contract. The dispute was eventually resolved through mediation, with the employee's contributions remaining in the Blender project under a different license.


## Protecting Yourself

If your contract contains problematic IP clauses, reach out to your company's HR department or your manager to request an addendum. Here is a draft clause you can propose:

> Notwithstanding the provisions regarding Intellectual Property ownership, you may create and contribute original work to open-source projects during your personal time, including evenings, weekends, holidays, and leave periods, subject to the following conditions:
>
> 1. The open-source project is not directly related to or in competition with the Company's business, products, or services.
>
> 2. Your contributions to the open-source project are original works created entirely during your personal time and do not include or derive from any of the Company's proprietary or confidential information, trade secrets, or intellectual property.
>
> 3. You will retain ownership rights to any original intellectual property created for the open-source project during your personal time, and the Company agrees to waive any claims to such intellectual property. Furthermore, you have the right to transfer ownership of such intellectual property to other parties through contributor license agreements as necessary for the purpose of contributing to the open-source project.
>
> This addendum does not grant you any rights to use the Company's resources, including but not limited to hardware, software, or confidential information, for open-source contributions without prior written consent from the Company.

Many employers are willing to add such clauses when the request is framed professionally and the conditions are reasonable.
